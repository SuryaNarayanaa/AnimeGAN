# GAN Project

This repository contains code and resources for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Demo

Here is a demo of the GAN in action:
