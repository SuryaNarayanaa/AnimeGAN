# GAN Project

This repository contains code and resources for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Demo

Here is a demo of the GAN in action:

## Generate Your Own Images

To generate your own images using the GAN, you can use the `image_generation.py` script. Follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. Use conda for the installation
    

2. Run the `image_generation.py` script with the correct model file:

    ```bash
    python image_generation.py
    ```

3. The generated images will be opened in a new window.

For more details, refer to the [image_generation.py](image_generation.py) script.
